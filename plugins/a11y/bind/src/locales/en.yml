      Bind command is meant to bind user accounts across multiple platforms.
      In this process, the data from the source platform will be preserved, while the data from the target platform will be overwritten.
      Make sure that you are on the target platform, and send the following text to any robot on the source platform within 5 minutes:
      {0}
      Note: Each account can only be bound to each platform once, and this operation will erase the data on your current platform, please operate with caution!
